Hi! My name is Josef Schwarz.
I live in Petersfield and go to Langrish Primary School (Ramsdean Rd, Stroud, Petersfield GU32 3PJ).
If I seem lost, upset, or scared, please call my parents:
Heiko: +44 7517 05 9191
Katy: +44 7759 85 0918

If Iâ€™m upset or need help calming down:

Speak gently and calmly; short, simple sentences work best.

Give me some space and time to breathe.

Loud noises or shouting can make things worse.

I may not want to talk straight away â€” thatâ€™s okay.

I like gentle contact only if I start it. Please donâ€™t touch my head.

I calm down faster if I know whatâ€™s happening next.

If Iâ€™m tired, hungry, or thirsty, that can make it harder for me to cope.

I like playing with cars and tractors.

Thank you for helping me feel safe. ðŸ’›
